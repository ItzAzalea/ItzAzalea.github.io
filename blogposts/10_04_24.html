					<p>
					yeah!! i adopted a doggy, her name is athena, shes a year old, and shes a husky-german shepherd mix!!
					</p>
					<p>
					i realllly wanted a kitty but i wasnt allowed to get one so that made me a little sad, either way im glad to have a nice and sweet dog, altho she does need to be potty trained but its aight. there were also some other super cute and nice dogs at the adoption place and the pound that we wanted but i picked athena over them. i still want a kitty tho :(
					</p>
					<h2 class="heading">other mundane stuff</h2>
					<p>
					like most other days today wasnt very eventful besides for the new dog, i went to have lunch with my grandma, cousin, and a family friend was nice, and my sister and uncle also came over for the weekend, but idk if they really like me cus of varrrrious things
					</p>
					<p>
					ive felt exremely guilty about eating food as of late and i either end up binging or starving, idk ill be okay tho, i miss my friends a lot too, like a shit ton, i feel so left out and i really want to see and talk to them again, idk this wednesday we might be able to hang out or ik for sure on one of my friends birthday i can go see them
					</p>
