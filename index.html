					i got my school stuff set up today, cus im doing online school i had a meeting with my career advisor and teacher
					</p>
					<p>
          it was kinda extremely borring, i took effectively a personality quiz to help me find a career, it did nothing and i ended up having to scroll so far down the page to find a job i liked. i also just got general school stuff set up and yeah it was aight but nothing special. tho after i got to look around the thrift store, didnt find anything but still fun
					</p>
					<h2 class="heading">doctors appointment and home stuff</h2>
					<p>
          i went to the doctor and guess what, i got my anti depressants uped!!! i hope they finally start working
					</p>
					<p>
					last night wasnt fun, i felt really down and ended up having to take my anxiety med but i also took some extra of other pills to feel smth, i kinda regret that now but its whatever. its been a decent day tho, ive been fasting today and i hope i stick with it
					<p>
					i dont got nothing else to say so yeah, to anyone even reading this, love ya and thanks <3
