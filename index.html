					<h2 class="heading">MOST RECENT BLOGPOST</h2>
					<div class="blogpost">
						<p>september 28th, 2024</p>
						<h1 class="heading">kickass new sidebar</h1>
						<p>hey y'all. actually, i'm not entiely sure if anyone reads these blogposts but i don't care! i'm gonna keep makin' them!</p>
						<p>anyway, check out that sick new sidebar to the left of every page! at the top, there will be some sort of random thing i write. kinda like a blogpost but shorter, and super unimportant.</p>
						<p>below that, theres a neat little uhmmhm,,., thing? with an array of "buttons"! (none of them actually go anywhere or do anything right now. sorry lol.) i just thought it'd be cool and i couldn't come up with anything else to fill the sidebar with.</p>
						<p>below the buttons is a link to the most recent blogpost. is it a little redundant? yea... kinda... do i care? no, not really. :3</p>
						<p>i dunno. i think the sidebar really fills in some empty space the website had before i added it, and it's pretty cool! i think.</p>
						<p>i might add some more crap there in the future if i can come up with anything. but for now, that's all for the sidebar.</p>

						<h2 class="heading">almost october</h2>
						<p>two more days til september packs it up, and october shows up with all the spooky nonsense that follows suit.</p>
						<p>i actually like october quite a bit. it usually marks the beginning of fall, which is my favorite season out of the four. it's nice and cool out so there's no need to worry about nearly dying of heatstroke everyday, and the orange foliage is very pretty!</p>
						<p>but alas, not every good thing can go without something bad to balance things out.</p>
						<p>early preparations.</p>
						<p>i swear to god what is up with people always immediately setting up halloween decorations n shit as soon as october starts?</p>
						<p>can't walk into a grocery store without being sucker-punched in the nose with a sickening amount of pumpkin spice, and being visually assaulted with some cheap halloween decor in every corner of the store.</p>
						<p>don't even get me started on the massive colorful bags of candy everywhere.</p>
						<p>listen, i'm all for being prepared for something before it happens but fucking hell halloween is at the end of the month y'all! you have 30 days to prepare, you are all fine!</p>
						<p>i suppose i can understand why stores prepare so early, they have more things to set up, and it's good for business. but just some chump across the streeet? it doesn't take a month to put up some silly lawn decorations dude, you can calm down a bit.</p>
						<p>i'll be honest for a bit here (not like i haven't been), i haven't gone trick-or-treat-ing in like... uhmm. a long time! last time i went that i can recall was when i was like, 8 years old or something.</p>
						<p>it's a nice little tradition but god it's just really not my thing. going up to someone's house in a cheap costume just to get some candy? i dunno.</p>
						<p>some people really go all out for their costumes though. which usually nets them some better or extra candy.</p>
						<p>pretty smart honestly. you get rewarded for your awesome costume and you can show it off to some kids that are all dressed up like the same five superheros.</p>
						<br>
						<p>that's all i got for tonight. still unsure if anyone reads these posts, and there's no way for me to check that. but, if you are reading this, thanks for taking some time out of your day to sit down and read these big walls of text i ripped out of my brain.</p>
